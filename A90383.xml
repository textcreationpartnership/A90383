            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Gallen</hi> doth much commend <hi>Aloes,</hi> and alſo <hi>Hiera pigra,</hi> and ſaith it is a very profitable Medicament, and gratefull to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and many praiſe it, for that it takes away viſcuous and corrupt humours that are contained in the Tunicles of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. <hi>Meſue</hi> counts it one of the beſt and wholeſomeſt Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which hath a prerogative above all Medicines. For when other purging Medicines doe weaken the ſtomach, and hurt the members or parts, the taking of <hi>Aloes</hi> doth not only not hurt, but doth much comfort the ſtomack; yea, he thinks if it be often taken, it makes all the parts and members ſound. But <hi>Cardanus</hi> and others are of a contrary minde, and condemne <hi>Gallen</hi> for that (<hi>De tuend. ſan. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 45.) he ſaith, <hi>Aloes</hi> is a friend to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: Further, they ſay, being bitter and loathſome, it is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the Stomach, becauſe the Stomach is much delighted with ſweet things: Moreover they ſay, <hi>Hierapigra,</hi> although it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ſometimes not unprofitable to take it, yet it is hurtfull to the Stomach, and prejudiciall to the life. But I conceive that the uſe of <hi>Aloes</hi> doth much prevaile to preſerve health, ſeing it doth not only purge away the excrements in the bowels, but alſo it purgeth crude humours, as alſo Flegmatick and Chollerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from the Stomach, and doth reſiſt putrifaction, being alſo ſomewhat aſtringent: Only note, That it muſt be given but in a ſmall quantity, and not too often; for if it be given often, and in a great quantity, ſo that it come to the Liver, it doth much hurt, eſpecially to thoſe that have dry bodies and hot Livers.</p>

But this controverſie may be thus decided or reconciled; if we ſay that <hi>Aloes</hi> being outwardly applied doth ſhut the mouths of the veins, and ſo doth ſtay any Flux of the Bloud; but being inwardly taken, ſo that it pierce or penetrate to the veins, it cauſeth bloud to flow.

                  <head>Whether Campher be cold or hot, and whether it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh Venery or luſt?</head>
                  <p>There is ſome controverſie among Phyſitians, about the nature of <hi>Campher,</hi> moſt agree that <hi>Campher</hi> is cold, and that without doubt, becauſe it is uſed in externall heats and inflamations, that
<pb facs="tcp:118117:29"/>
commeth by being in the Sun too long; and becauſe it helpeth pain of the head, and cureth inflamations of the eyes, as alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth Venery. Others eſpecially, late Writers ſay, <hi>Campher</hi> is hot, and that upon theſe grounds. Firſt, Becauſe of its infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mability, for it doth not only burne eaſily, but being ſet on fire, and caſt into the water it will burne there: But this Argument <hi>Scaliger exercit:</hi> 104. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8. doth reject and deride, but without juſt cauſe. For nothing doth thus burne, except it be of a ſulphurous and butuminous nature, as ſome conceive: Now all inflamabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, or ſuch as are of burning and fiery nature are hot, from whence it appears that <hi>Campher</hi> is hot; although on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we may not conclude, that all things that are hot, are of a burning nature. Secondly, <hi>Campher</hi> ſeems to be hot by it's taſte, being bitter, how we ſay, <hi>quod amarum calidum,</hi> that which is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is hot. Thirdly, the ſtrong ſmell or ſent thereof doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it to be hot. Fourthly, the tenuity or thinneſſe of parts, and it's great penetrating faculty doth manifeſt it to be hot; for ſuch properties are not to be found in cold things. Now that <hi>Campher</hi> doth extinguiſh heat, heals inflamations, and mitigates paine of the head, proceeding from a hot cauſe, this it doth by accident, in drawing hot vapours and humours away, and ſo diſcuſſing them in the ſame manner as <hi>Linſeed-oyle, Vernix</hi> and ſuch like doth cure burning. Others would reconcile the difference thus; by ſaying, <hi>Campher</hi> doth conſiſt of a double faculty or ſubſtance, as is in <hi>Veniger, Rubarbe, &amp;c.</hi> one hot which cauſeth the penetrating, ſharpe and burning faculty, the other cold, which extinguiſheth luſt, and helps inflamations of the eyes: But ſurely <hi>Campher</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hot; for though it be affirmed to be cold, yet tis not eaſily proved: Neither can the double ſubſtance, in <hi>Campher</hi> be ſeparated, as in <hi>Rubarbe</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> for the whole ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is hot, and of a fiery nature, and nothing at all cold; for though it do cool, yet it is not <hi>per ſe,</hi> of it's proper nature, but by accident, as it is before ſhewed. Now concerning it's faculty in extinguiſhing Venery, tis denied by <hi>Scaliger, exercit.</hi> 104. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8. For he thus writes, <hi>extingui venerem ea non eſſe verum, pro certo habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> We have certain experience that <hi>Campher</hi> doth not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Venery, for ſaith he, a young man did the feat ſtrongly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had a piece thereof in his hand: Alſo he tryed it upon a proud Bitch, by giving it inwardly, and uſing it outward, but all in vain; <hi>Coivit, concepit, peperit.</hi> But this experience is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
<pb facs="tcp:118117:29"/>
for when it is ſaid, <hi>Campher</hi> doth extinguiſh Luſt, it is not ſo to be underſtood, as if by one act, or by uſing it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly once or twice, it ſhould prevaile, but if it be often uſed doth inwardly and outwardly. <hi>Dan.

Therefore it muſt not be given to women with child (for being but applyed to the wombe, it killeth the child) nor to children, aged perſons, or ſuch as are weake, neither to any that have the <hi>Pluriſie, Hectich</hi> Feaver, or any inflamation. It is not ſafe to give it alone, but being well corrected it may be given to ſtrong and ruſtick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It is corrected with <hi>Hepaticall, Cardiacall, Stomachicall,</hi> and other gentle means, as <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> oyle of ſweet <hi>Almonds, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> or <hi>Maſtich:</hi> Some adde <hi>Bdellium,</hi> and other aſtringent things. But ſurely thoſe things that binde make the operation of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, afterwards more ſtrong; for though the binding faculty of ſuch things may hinder the operation for a time, yet it will at length bring forth and worke more violently. <hi>Sagapenum</hi> is counted a good corrector of <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> becauſe of it's clammy faculty, whereby it preſerves the bowels from gripings</p>

But ſure they are deceived that judge it to be made up of Aloes, and that becauſe it is not bitter as Aloes is; moreover, it purgeth rather water than choler. Neither can it be made of Euphorbium, for then it would burn and heat more in the mouth then it doth; nor is it likely to be made of Rubarbe, for it hath neither the taſte nor qualities of Rubarbe; beſides, Rubarbe is a ſtranger in thoſe places from whence this is brought.

It is profitable againſt pain &amp; noyſe of the eares, and againſt ſtubborn and contumacious diſeaſes. It is counted as an Antidote againſt the Leproſie, Scab, Tetter, &amp;c. hardneſſe and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Spleen, old quartane Agues, pains of the joynts, Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes and the Kings Evil. It quickneth the brain and ſenſes, provokes urine, and brings down the Courſes in women. It hath an excellent faculty to draw away whatſoever is mixed with the bloud, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it to corrupt, and is profitable in a long continued Jaundiſe. Some ſay it will cauſe the Devill to be caſt out, being taken by ſuch as are poſſeſſed. Thus we may ſay, that although the Devil cannot be caſt out by humane art or phyſicall means, yet by taking black <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,</hi> the melancholy humour is drawn away (which is <hi>Balneum &amp; ſedes Diaboli,</hi> the bath and ſeat of the Devill, and ſo the Devill is more eaſily caſt out, from whence it may rightly (ſay ſome) be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>fuga Daemonum.</hi> But I think the white <hi>Hellebore,</hi> rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves this name then the black.

The powder put into Fiſtulaes, or hollow Ulcers; doth ſoon heal them, and if there be callons, or hard fleſh grown in the Fiſtula, the root left in it for two or three dayes, will conſume it quite, and put into a wound where dead or ſpongious fleſh is, it conſumes it, and preſerves the fleſh from putrefaction. A decoction thereof helpeth the tooth-ach, and the ſores of the mouth, being gargled; and being put into the eares, it helpeth the noyſe thereof. A Peſſary made of the root, and put up, prevailes wonderfully to bring down the termes or courſes in women. A Cataplaſme or Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis made of the root, with Barley-meale, and wine, is good to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the bellies of ſuch as have the Dropſy.

                  <p>There are two things in the uſe of <hi>Hermodactyles</hi> to be minded. Firſt, that the hurtfull quality may be taken away; for it troubleth the ſtomach, and cauſeth windineſſe; now to help this, let it be mixed with Cummin-ſeed, Maſtick, Ginger, Long-pepper, Mint, Cynamon, Cloves, or Mace. Secondly, that means be uſed to quicken its ſlow operation, and (for of it ſelf it works but ſlowly) by ſharp means. <hi>Meſue</hi> commends Sea-onion for this purpoſe, if Troſſes be made of the juice thereof with the powder of <hi>Hermodactyle.,</hi> Ginger, and Sal gem. Neither is it unprofitable to this purpoſe, if you make Troſſes or little cakes thereof with Ginger, and the juice of Radiſh. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from the joynts, it will be proper to mix with it a little <hi>Eupher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi> well corrected. Alſo if the eſſence thereof be drawn forth with ſpirit of wine or the like, it will be very uſefull for the forenamed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.

                  <p>Moſt of the Ancient writers ſay <hi>Opium</hi> is cold in the fourth degree, others will have it partly cold and partly hot; but ſome of the new Writers will have it to be altogether hot, as <hi>Sennertus, Doringius, Schroderus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons given that it is hot are theſe. 1. Becauſe it is bitter, now that which is bitter is hot, but <hi>Opium</hi> is bitter, therefore hot. 2. It is ſharp and biting, that being put upon the tongue it bites and bliſters the ſame and palate. 3. Cauſeth dryneſſe. 4. It is of a very ſtrong ſmell and ſavour. 5. It doth ſoone burne and flame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on fire; for the true <hi>Opium</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plinie</hi>) will burne like a Candle; From whence we reaſon thus, <hi>Omne quod citò inflammatur, eſt calidum: Opium citò inflammatur: Ergo calidum.</hi> That which doth ſoon burne and flame is hot, but <hi>Opium</hi> doth ſoone burne and fleme, therefore it is hot. 6. It troubleth the minde, and brings a kinde of madneſſe or dotage to ſuch as take it. 7. It ſtirs up and provokes Venery. 8. It ſtirs up and provokes the Itch. 9. It provokes ſweat. 10. It ſoftneth hardneſſe, and diſcuſſeth, or diſſolveth ſwellings, all which are effects of heat. Now though <hi>Opium</hi> be narcoticall, or ſtupefactive, or make dull and ſenſeleſſe; yet this doth not proceed from its frigidity, or coldneſſe, but this it doth by an occult, or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den quality.</p>

                     <hi>Opopanax</hi> purgeth thick and tough flegme from remote parts, as from the brain, nerves, ſenſitive parts, joynts, and breaſts; therefore it is profitable for any cold diſeaſe incident to any of thoſe parts, as in the Palſie, in debility, or weakneſſe of the ſight, old cough, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of breath, <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and in other kindes of Gowt. It is good for Convulſions and Cramgs, as alſo againſt winde in the belly, Stitches in the ſide, hardneſſe of the Spleen, Strangury, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in making urine. It likewiſe diſcuſſeth the Windineſſe, Hardneſſe, and Suffocations of the Mother, and bringeth down the courſes, and brings away alſo the <hi>mola</hi> or lump of fleſh bred in the Wombe. Being drunk with Water and Honey, or Wine it helpeth the Itchings and inward ſoares of the Bladder. It expelleth Wormes, helpeth the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a mad Dog, and is good againſt poyſons of other venomous creatures. Diſſolved in Wine and given, it helps the Dropſie; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Vineger one houre before the fit commeth, it takes away the cold fit of an Ague, and eſpecially if you diſſolve ſome of it with the juice of Smallage and Oile of Dill, and anoint the ridge of the back therewith. It is good after falls and bruiſes to diſſolve any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed bloud, eſpecially in cold bodies, and where no Feaver is.

                  <head>The names.</head>
                  <p>Elder is called in Latine <hi>Sambucus</hi> from <hi>Sambix</hi> the firſt finder of it.</p>
                  <p>Dane-wort is called Low-Elder, in Latine <hi>Ebulus,</hi> in Engliſh Wall-wort, Dane-wort, or Dwarfe-Elder.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The inward uſe.</head>
                  <p>There is in uſe the flowers, leaves, inward barke or rinde, the Seeds, Berries, and the ſpongie ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>They are profitable in the Dropſie, joynt-Gowt, Agues, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſwellings of the ſpleen, ſtone of the Kidneys, affects of the Wombe, and St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire. They purge tough flegme, water and thin choler chiefly from the belly and joynts. They are good in the Scorbute or Scurvy, and kill wormes in the ſtomach or belly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſhoots, or young leaves of the Elder boiled in Broth or Poſſet-drink, draweth forth ſtrongly choler and tough flegme; the tender leaves eaten with Oile and Salt do the ſame. The inner bark boiled in water and given to drink, worketh much more violently; and the berries alſo green or dry expell the ſame humour, and is often given with good ſucceſſe to help the Dropſie, by evacuating great plenty of wateriſh humours: the bark of the root alſo boiled in Wine, or the juice thereof drunk, worketh the ſame effect, but more effectually then either leaves or fruit do; the juice of the root taken, provoketh vomit mightily, and purgeth the watery humours of the Dropſie. The decoction of the root cureth the biting of the Adder, as alſo of a mad Dogge, and bringeth downe the courſes of women.</p>
                  <p>The decoction of the Berries in Wine being drunk provoketh Urine. The powder of the ſeeds firſt prepared in Vineger, and then taken in Wine, halfe a dram at a time for certaine dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a meanes to abate and conſume the fat fleſh of a corpulent body, and to keep it leane. The Berries ſo prepared, and as much with <hi>Tartar,</hi> and a few Aniſe-ſeeds put to them, a dram of this powder given in Wine, cureth the Dropſie by purging very gently The dry flowers are often uſed in decoction for Gliſters to expell
<pb facs="tcp:118117:87"/>
winde, and eaſeth the Collick; for they loſe their purging quality which they have being green, and reteine an attenuating. The flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Ale or Beere are very good for ſuch as have the Dropſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into a bag. The flowers of both provoke ſweat. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger made of the flowers of Elder, by Ma ceration and ſetting in the Sunne is much more uſed in <hi>France</hi> then any where elſe, and is gratefull to the ſtomach, and effectuall to quicken the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and helpeth to cut groſſe and tough flegme in the breaſt. The diſtilled water of the inner bark of the Tree, or of the root, is very powerfull to purge the waterie humours of the Dropſie, or Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, taking it faſting and two hours before ſupper: The doſe is two ounces in the morning, and as much before ſupper, or take foure ounces in the morning. The water of the flowers alſo is good in the Dropſie, and openeth the ſtoppings of the Liver, Spleen and Reines: it driveth away the tertian Ague, and is good againſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and ſtrengthneth the ſtomach. The doſe is three or foure ounces faſting.</p>
                  <p>The Muſhromes of the Elder called Jewes-eares, are much uſed (being dryed and boiled with Ale or milke with Columbine-leaves) for ſore throats, and with a little Pepper and Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi> in powder to put up the <hi>Uvula</hi> or palate of the mouth when it is fallen downe.</p>
                  <p>The young and tender branches of Dane-wort and leaves thereof taken with Wine, helpeth thoſe that are troubled with the ſtone and gravell. The juice of the root is a ſtrong purger of watery humours, and excellent for the Dropſie. The leaves boiled in water and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to drink, helpeth the dry Cough and the Quinſie. The dryed Berries or Seeds beaten to powder and taken in Wine faſting, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame effect as the juice of the root doth. The powder of the ſeeds taken in the decoction of Ground-pine, and a little Cyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the quantity of a dram at a time, is an approved remedy both for the Gowt, joint-aches and Sciatica, as alſo for the French diſeaſe, for it eaſeth the paines by withdrawing the humours from the places affected, and by drawing forth thoſe humours that are fluent, peccant and offenſive: the powder of the root worketh the ſame effect. The root ſteeped in Wine all night, and a draught thereof given before the fit of an Ague, doth much prevaile to abate the fit, or to take it quite away, eſpecially taken the ſecond or third time if need be. In a word, what hath been ſaid of Elder may be ſaid of Dane-wort, only Dane-wort is more forceable or power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then Elder.</p>

The juice of the berries boiled with a little Honey, and dropped into the eares, eaſeth the paines of them.</p>
                  <p>A decoction of the root maketh the haire black if it be waſhed therewith: the leaves boiled till they be tender, then beaten and mixed with Barley-meale, and applyed to hot inflammations, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwageth them, and helpeth places that are burnt either by fire or water, cureth Fiſtulous Ulcers being laid thereupon; and eaſeth the paines of the Gowt being beaten and boiled with tallow of a Bull, or Goat, and laid warme thereon. The young buds and leaves of the Elder, and as much of the roots of Plantaine beaten together, and boiled in Hogs-greaſe, this being laid warme upon the place pained with the Gowt doth give preſent eaſe thereto: the leaves alſo burnt, and the powder of them put up into the Noſtrils ſtayeth the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once or twice uſed. The leaves of Elders boiled tender, and applied warme to the fundament, eaſeth the paines of the Piles, if
<pb facs="tcp:118117:88"/>
they be once or twice renewed growing cold. The pitch in the middle of the Elder ſtalkes, being dried and put into the cavernous, or hollovv holes of Fiſtulous Ulcers that are ready to cloſe, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and dilateth the Orifices, whereby injections may be uſed, and other remedies applied for the cure of them. The Muſhromes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Jewes-eares, helpeth the inflammation of the eyes being mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or ſteeped in Roſe-water, or Plantaine-water, and the eyes waſhed therewith. The dryed Jewes-eares ſteeped in Roſe-water and applied to the Temples and forehead, do eaſe the paines of the head or head-ach. The diſtilled water of the flowers of Elder, is of much uſe to cleare the skin from Sun-burning, Freckles, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew or the like: and both the fore-part and hinder-part of the head being bathed therewith, it taketh away all manner of head-ach that commeth of a cold cauſe. The ſame water taketh away the heat and inflammation of the eyes, and helpeth them when they are blood-ſhotten. The hands being waſhed morning and evening with the ſame vvater of the flovver doth much help and eaſe them that have the Palſy in them, and cannot keep them from ſhaking.</p>
                  <p>The foule inflamed or old Ulcers and ſores of the leggs, being often vvaſhed vvith the vvater of the leaves or of the flovvers diſtilled in the middle of the moneth of <hi>Maey</hi> doth heale them in a ſhort ſpace. The water alſo helpeth the paine of the ſide, if a linnen cloth be vvet therein, and the ſide bathed therevvith vvarme. Oile of Elder-flovvers doth aſſvvage paine, cleanſe and mundifie the skin, profiteth in ſtoppings of the Liver and ſpleene, and is good for the paines of the joynts and nerves, and is very uſefull in burning and wild-fire. An ointment made of the green leaves of Dan-wort &amp; <hi>May</hi> butter made in the Moneth of <hi>May,</hi> is accounted with many a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne remedy for all outward paines, aches and cramps in the joynts, nerves or ſinewes, for ſtarckneſſe and lameneſſe by cold and other caſualties, and generally to warme, comfort, and ſtrengthen all the outward parts ill-affected, as alſo to mollifie the hardneſſe, and to open the obſtructions of the ſpleen, the grieved parts anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith.</p>
